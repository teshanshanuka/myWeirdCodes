Test with cold juction cover with clay.
Put the entire PCB in a card board box
Diode average set
Changed C14 from 0.01uF to 0.1uF
Changed C14 back to normal value

RTD
Changed the RTD sense resistor to half of the value (50050Ohm) and increase the current to 100uA
Changed the RTD sense resitor to 2001 and increased the current to 250uA

Just a run with upto latest changes

Changed the thermocouple col-juction diode from single ended to differential ( 4 & 5 are using external power supply )

Changed the C14 from 0.01uF to 0.2uF
Changed the C14 from 0.2uf 0.3uF
Changed the C14 from 0.3uF to 0.2uF and increase the series resistance from 1k to 2k from both sides
Changed the sereies resistance from 2k to 5.05k

Changed series resistance from 5.05k to 1k both.
