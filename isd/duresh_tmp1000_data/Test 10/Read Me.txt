Test with cold juction cover with clay.
Put the entire PCB in a card board box
Diode average set
Changed C14 from 0.01uF to 0.1uF
Changed C14 back to normal value

RTD
Changed the RTD sense resistor to half of the value (50050Ohm) and increase the current to 100uA
Changed the RTD sense resitor to 2001 and increased the current to 250uA

Just a run with upto latest changes

Changed the thermocouple col-juction diode from single ended to differential ( 4 & 5 are using external power supply )
